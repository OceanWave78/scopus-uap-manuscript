**Summary of Final Review**

-   **Structural Integrity**: The article is organised into the standard
    sections of an academic paper: Abstract, Introduction, distinct
    thematic sections for the main body, a Discussion, a Conclusion, and
    a consolidated References list. This structure ensures clarity and
    meets journal submission requirements.

-   **Academic Tone and Language**: The language used throughout is
    formal, precise, and objective. All colloquialisms have been
    removed, and the tone is consistently analytical and scholarly.

-   **Logical Coherence**: The argument progresses logically from one
    section to the next. The paper begins by establishing the topic\'s
    contemporary relevance, delves into the evidence (official,
    experiential, and historical), explores the theoretical
    implications, discusses the broader societal impact, and concludes
    by synthesizing the findings into a cohesive thesis.

-   **Citation and Referencing**: All in-text citations and the final
    reference list have been double-checked to ensure they adhere
    strictly to the APA 7th Edition style guide. This consistency is
    critical for academic credibility.

-   **Keywords**: A set of keywords has been added after the abstract.
    These terms (e.g., *Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)*,
    *Scientific Materialism*, *Consciousness*, *Disclosure*) are
    essential for ensuring the article is discoverable in academic
    databases like Scopus.
