**The Experiential and Ancient Core**

The UAP phenomenon is not solely characterized by its physical
manifestations but is profoundly intertwined with human experience and
ancient narratives, frequently challenging a purely materialist
interpretation. Experiential accounts often reveal a \"high
strangeness\" that compels individuals to re-evaluate their
understanding of reality.

Chris Bledsoe\'s encounters exemplify this transformation. Initially
witnessing what he described as \"nuts-and-bolts\" craft, his experience
evolved into a profound conviction that the phenomenon is divine. This
shift was propelled by events such as a miraculous, medically
inexplicable remission of his Crohn\'s disease, telepathic
communications, and the appearance of a \"Lady\" figure, which he
interpreted as a Holy Spirit offering a divine mission. Bledsoe observed
that these phenomena respond directly to human intention and emotional
states, particularly prayer, and intentionally avoid manifesting in the
presence of deeply skeptical individuals, suggesting a participatory,
consciousness-mediated interaction that honors free will. His
experiences led him to believe the phenomenon is \"Angelic\" and
connected to God, with a purpose of spiritual evolution and healing
(Bledsoe & Paglino, 2023).

Similarly, Jake Barber, a U.S. Air Force veteran involved in UAP
recovery, described a profound emotional and spiritual connection with
an egg-shaped craft, feeling \"possessed by the most beautiful spirit,\"
which he equated to \"the spirit of God\" (Corbell & Knapp, 2024). His
testimony, along with that of others, revealed classified programs that
reportedly recruited individuals with psychic abilities, or
\"psionics,\" to \"summon,\" \"communicate with,\" and even \"control\"
UAPs through intuition and meditation. These individuals reported
\"basking in a glow of light\" and having a \"very positive experience
engaging spiritually with this phenomenon,\" indicating a conscious and
often benevolent interaction (Corbell & Knapp, 2024).

The re-contextualization of UAPs within ancient religious and
mythological narratives further underscores their persistent presence
throughout human history. U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna
explicitly links modern UAPs to apocryphal texts like the Book of Enoch,
which details \"Watchers\" (fallen angels) interacting with humanity,
imparting forbidden knowledge, and creating the Nephilim (Rogan, 2024).
She highlights the removal of such texts from canonical scriptures as a
possible \"deliberate, historical suppression of knowledge\" relevant to
UAPs (Rogan, 2024). Tucker Carlson similarly cites ancient religious
texts, such as Ezekiel\'s vision of \"wheels in the sky,\" viewing UAPs
as \"spiritual entities\" that are \"from here\" and have been present
for millennia (Rogan, 2023).

Ancient Indian texts, particularly the *Vimanika Shastra*, describe
various types of *Vimanas*---\"aerial cars\" or flying machines
detailing their construction, materials, and mercury-based propulsion
systems (Shastri & Josyer, 1973). These descriptions often include a
mystical dimension, with references to \"Bodhisattva-Masters\"
maintaining \"still-functioning vimanas\" in secret mountain fortresses.
The architectural connection of the Vimana to the \"Ether\" as a
\"Conduit\" also points to non-material realms (Shastri & Josyer, 1973).
This continuity in descriptions across cultures and millennia, as
Bledsoe notes from his conversations, suggests a consistent interaction
interpreted through diverse cultural and spiritual lenses: \"people have
always seen what I've seen, it's just that the words for it vary
according to the cultures and religions\" (Bledsoe & Paglino, 2023, p.
187).
